## **Issue**
ROS2 Eloquent depends on PCL `1.8.0`. However, the `ensensor_grabber.h` header file is only available in PCL `1.8.1`.

In manually copying over the file to `usr/include/` folder using sudo privilege, running **colcon build**, generates the following compilation error:

```bash

CMakeFiles/main.dir/src/ros_driver.cpp.o: In function `ROSDriver::ROSDriver()':
ros_driver.cpp:(.text+0x8b1): undefined reference to `pcl::EnsensoGrabber::EnsensoGrabber()'
ros_driver.cpp:(.text+0x8de): undefined reference to `pcl::EnsensoGrabber::openTcpPort(int)'
ros_driver.cpp:(.text+0x900): undefined reference to `pcl::EnsensoGrabber::openDevice(int)'
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

Failed   <<< ros_driver [2.71s, exited with code 2]

Summary: 0 packages finished [3.05s]
  1 package failed: ros_driver
  1 package had stderr output: ros_driver

```

## **Follow-Up**
1. Build PCL 1.8.1 from source. Have `ros_driver`'s CMakeLists.txt link to the custom library location. Add as git submodule if this is successful.

## **Updated as of 10th August 2021**
The above compilation error is due to the absence of `ensenso_grabber.cpp`. Adding the file from the PCL Library under `src` and linking to `CMakeLists.txt` resolved the issue.

The follow-up also resolved the issue by having the required `ensenso_grabber.h` library header file.
